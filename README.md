# hello-world.
My first repository. There are many of these coming soon.
I'm an Mechatronic engineer as well as a programmer enthusiast from Venezuela. I have a background in C language and C++. C++ is the one I love most. I have also programmed in OptoScript as well as Qlarity Object Oriented language. These come from my industrial background.
Now working with the Internet of Things systems, I want to get a new journey, JavaScript and Node.js. Any help will be well received. I will post code,ideas,anything from my learning process here on GitHub. Feel free to comment anything you might consider beneficial. May God Bless you all! Viva Venezuela.
